# Mobile UI Practice

**This repository contains Unity project for mobile UI system practice.**

**System Explain : For each(or certain) second(s), resource is created, and by upgrade, user can increase resource-per-unit-time.**

**User input and UI related codes are implemented by UniRx(reactive programming).**

**By touching bottom tabs, user can change lower side background.**

**Also, in some lower side background, user can change background by touching tabs in the background.**

**Background and tabs are implemented by BackGround/TabButton scripts, so this function(shifting background by touching tabs) works independently with background-tab hierarchy.**
